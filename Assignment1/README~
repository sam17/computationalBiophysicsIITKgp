ASSIGNMENT 1: COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS
/**************************************/

The project parses through a specified PDB file and reads the atoms in a given chain and then caclulates the dihedral angles PHI, PSI and OMEGA.

Running:

1. Extract Zip
2. Go to the directory on terminal.
3. Type: cmake .
4. Type: make
5. Type: ./pdbRead <PDB FILE> >out
	Example: ./pdbRead 12AS.pdb >out


This writes out the dihedral angles of chain specified of given PDB file in file named out.
